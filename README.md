**ldapctl** is a openLDAP CLI based on [ldap](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap) library. ðŸš€

It only takes two steps to start the ldapctl experienceï¼š

1. use docs/start-ldap-eryajf.sh script Start a openLDAP instance locally through dockerã€‚
2. Run the make build compilation project, and then you can test it.ã€‚

If you want to manage your ldap, you can directly modify the configuration information in public/public.go, then compile the project and put it into use.

At present, it provides simple management of users and groups, which is mainly used to learn ldap library. There may be some deficiencies. Welcome to communicate.
